### Hi there, I am Shatabarto "Rik" BhattacharyaðŸ‘‹
So everyone is doing `README.md` for their github, so here I am, hopping on the bandwagon.    
DevOps, Blockchain, ML/DL, Music Production are few of the things that tickle my creative bone.    
I am pretty active on twitter, so hmu there if you want.
